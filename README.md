# Assembly Graphics Demo

This repository contains a demo project written in assembly language to demonstrate basic graphics operations. The project includes assembly source files and a batch file to run the demo.

## Files

### 1. `demo.asm`
This file contains the main assembly code for the demo. It handles the core logic of the program and manages the flow of the graphics display.

### 2. `graphics.asm`
This file includes the graphics routines used in the demo. It handles low-level drawing operations and other graphics-related tasks.

### 3. `run.bat`
A batch script to automate the assembly, linking, and execution of the demo. It compiles the `demo.asm` and `graphics.asm` files and then runs the resulting executable.

## Prerequisites

- **Assembler**: Ensure you have an assembler installed, such as TASM or NASM.
- **Linker**: A linker is required to produce the executable after assembling the code.
- **DOSBox**: If you're running on a modern system, you may need DOSBox or another emulator to run the compiled executable.
